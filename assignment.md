## Assignment: Product Inventory Display in React

### Objective:

Develop a product inventory display using React to showcase a list of items available in an online store.

### Task Overview:

1. **Product Data:**

   - Set up an array of objects representing products with properties like `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, and `quantity`.

2. **Display Products:**

   - Render the list of products showing their name, description, price, and quantity available.

3. **Highlight Low Stock:**

   - Implement conditional rendering to highlight products with low stock (e.g., quantity less than 5) with a different style or indicator.

### Guidelines:

- Utilize React for structuring and displaying the product inventory.
- Use React `useState` hook to initialize the product list.
- Use props and conditional rendering to showcase product details and highlight low stock items.
- Implement filtering functionality for price ranges using React state.

**File Structure:**

- Create all the necessary files within the `src` directory of your React project.

**Additional Notes:**

- You are not required to use `create-react-app` for this assignment, as the basic application structure is already provided.
